;;; Commentary:

;; dwim-compile provides context-aware compilation command.  Some
;; usages are:
;;
;; 1) If a source package is maintained one of maven, sbt, or gradle, it
;;    will automatically find the build tool file, then execute the build
;;    tool in that directory, not the directory of the current buffer.
;;
;; 2) Provide base template for the `compile' command.  For example,
;;    the compliation command will set to "cc" for `c-mode' and set to
;;    "c++" for `c++-mode'.
;;
;; Use `dwim-c/compile' instead of `compile' in your convenient key binding,
;; For example, add following snippets in your init file:
;;
;;    (require 'dwim-compile)
;;    (global-set-key [(control ?c) ?c] 'dwim-c/compile)
;;
;; `dwim-c/compile' will try to determine the possible build tools
;; described in `dwim-c/build-tool-alist'.  If multiple tools are possible,
;; it will ask you with completion.   Once a tool selected, it will cached
;; in the buffer local variable, `dwim-c/selected-build-tool'.  If you
;; invoke `dwim-c/compile' again, the cached result is called directly.
;;
;; If you want to ignore the cached result, provide a prefix argument
;; (C-u) to `dwim-c/compile'.  If you want to call `compile' directly,
;; provide two prefix arguments (C-u C-u).

  "Each entry has the form, (TOOL-NAME MATCH FUNC-OR-COMMANDS SEARCH-PARENTS)

TOOL-NAME is just a symbol represent the entry used in the
completion of build tools, just pick any reasonable name.

MATCH is a regular expression that represent the file name of the
specific tool.  Note that this regular expression need to match
whole file name.  Otherwise, `dwim-c/compile' will be confused.
The regular expression match will try to match file names in the
current directory, then try the parent directory until the root
directory.  You may pass major-mode name instead of a regular
expression.  In this case, only the current buffer mode is
matched.

If the argument, FUNC-OR-COMMANDS is nil, then `compile' will be
called in the directory that MATCH mached.  If it is non-nil,
then it must be one of (1) a command name to execute, (2) a
function with one argument, which is a file name of the current
buffer if any or the current buffer itself, or (3) a list of
commands or functions.  If it is a list, then the first available
one is used.

If the optional SEARCH-PARENTS is non-nil and MATCH is a regular
expression, then it will try to find the MATCHed file from the
current directory to the root directory.

Note that if FUNC-OR-COMMANDS is a command name, there is no way
to pass prefix arguments in it.")
