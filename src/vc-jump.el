;;;
;;; `vc-jump' switches the current buffer (possibly in another window)
;;; to the Version Controlled status buffer. (inspired by `dired-jump')
;;;
;;; For example, if you're editing a file controlled by CVS, `vc-jump'
;;; executes `cvs-status' in the file's directory.  Likewise, if the
;;; current file is controlled by GIT, `vc-jump' executes `git-status'
;;; in the file's directory.
;;;

;;; TODO:
;;;
;;;   - In a CVS/SVN controlled file, launching `vc-jump' in a file in
;;;     the sub-directory of a VC controlled directory creates a VC
;;;     status buffer in that directory, not the VC controlled root
;;;     directory.  (except GIT)
;;;
;;;   - Support for other VC systems.
